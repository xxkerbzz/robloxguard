# Product Requirements Document

## 1. Summary
RobloxGuard is a parental control SaaS platform that monitors children's Roblox accounts in real-time to prevent scams, unauthorized spending, and account hacking. The app connects directly to Roblox accounts and payment methods, using pattern detection to identify suspicious activity and send instant alerts to parents with options to block or allow transactions before they happen.

## 2. Target User
Parents of children aged 8-16 who play Roblox regularly. These parents are concerned about online safety and financial security, have experienced or fear unauthorized Robux purchases, and want proactive protection rather than reactive monitoring. They're typically tech-comfortable but not experts, value peace of mind, and are willing to pay $9-15/month per child for comprehensive protection. Many are active in parenting communities on Reddit (r/parentalcontrols with 20K+ members) and Facebook groups where Roblox fraud is frequently discussed.

## 3. Core Problem
Parents face three critical pain points: (1) Children fall victim to sophisticated in-game social engineering scams like "free Robux generators" that steal account credentials, (2) Unauthorized Robux withdrawals occur overnight without parental knowledge, resulting in hundreds of dollars in unexpected charges, and (3) Existing parental control solutions offer basic restrictions that tech-savvy children easily bypass and fail to address game-specific fraud patterns. The current solutions are reactive—parents discover fraud after it happens—rather than proactive prevention.

## 4. Value Proposition
Parents gain real-time protection with instant alerts that allow them to block suspicious transactions before money is spent. They receive immediate notifications when their child attempts to purchase from known scam sites, when someone tries to trade away expensive items, or when unusual spending patterns are detected. This transforms the experience from discovering fraud after the fact to preventing it proactively, giving parents control and peace of mind while their children play safely.

## 5. Core Features
- Real-time account monitoring with pattern detection to differentiate legitimate gameplay from potential fraud
- Instant alerts via SMS/text when suspicious activity is detected (scam purchases, unauthorized trades, unusual spending)
- Transaction blocking with parent approval workflow (block or allow options in alerts)
- Spending limits and budget controls per child account
- Friend request approval system to prevent social engineering attacks
- Weekly activity reports covering conversations, gameplay activity, and spending patterns
- Direct integration with Roblox accounts and payment methods

## 6. Differentiators
Unlike generic parental controls (Bark, Qustodio) that offer basic time limits and content filtering, RobloxGuard is purpose-built for Roblox with deep game-specific fraud detection. It monitors in-game transactions, item trades, and social interactions that generic tools miss. Unlike Roblox's built-in parental controls which are easily bypassed, RobloxGuard uses external monitoring that children cannot disable. The real-time blocking capability—stopping transactions before they happen—is unique in the market, as most solutions only alert after the fact.

## 7. Homepage Angle
"Your kid's Roblox account just got hacked and $200 disappeared overnight. RobloxGuard stops scams before they happen—monitoring your child's account in real-time and blocking suspicious transactions instantly. Get instant alerts, set spending limits, and protect your family from Roblox fraud."

## 8. Main SEO Entity
Roblox parental controls and fraud protection

## 9. Constraints
Assumes Roblox API access or alternative monitoring methods (may require screen monitoring or browser extension if API access is limited). Does not include protection for other gaming platforms in initial version (Fortnite, Minecraft expansion planned for later). Requires parent to have access to child's Roblox account credentials. Does not prevent all types of scams—focuses on financial fraud and unauthorized spending rather than general online safety education. Pricing model assumes $9-15/month per child subscription.

## 10. Positioning Statement
"This is a parental control SaaS platform for parents of Roblox players that helps prevent unauthorized spending and account fraud through real-time monitoring and instant transaction blocking."
