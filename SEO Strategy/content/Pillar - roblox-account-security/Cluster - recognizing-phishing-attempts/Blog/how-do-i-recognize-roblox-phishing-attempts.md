# How do I recognize Roblox phishing attempts?

## Topic Foundation

Recognizing Roblox phishing attempts requires understanding how phishing attacks work, identifying red flags in fake emails and websites, and teaching children to verify communications before sharing account information. Education combined with technical protection provides the best defense against credential theft.

## What are the red flags of phishing emails?

Phishing emails often have suspicious sender addresses that don't match official Roblox domains, contain urgent language pressuring immediate action, request passwords or personal information, include links to suspicious websites, or have poor grammar and spelling. Legitimate Roblox emails never ask for passwords and come from @roblox.com addresses.

Teach children to recognize these warning signs and to verify any suspicious emails with parents before taking action. When in doubt, contact Roblox support directly rather than clicking links in emails.

## How can I identify fake Roblox websites?

Fake Roblox websites mimic the official login page to trick users into entering credentials. Check the URL carefully—legitimate Roblox websites always use the "roblox.com" domain. Any variation, subdomain, or similar-looking domain like "roblox-generator.com" or "free-robux.net" is likely a scam.

These fake sites can look nearly identical to the real site, making URL verification essential. Teach children to always check the URL before entering login information and to ask a parent if they're unsure about a website's legitimacy.

## How do phishing attacks work?

Phishing attacks use fake communications that claim to be from Roblox support, requesting password verification or account information. These communications may include links to fake websites that look identical to the real Roblox site, where children enter their credentials which are then stolen.

The attacks are increasingly sophisticated, making them difficult for children to recognize. [Recognizing phishing attempts](/resources/roblox-account-security/recognizing-phishing-attempts) requires understanding these tactics and teaching children to verify communications before sharing information.

## What should I teach my child about phishing?

Teach children that legitimate Roblox communications never ask for passwords, that they should verify suspicious emails with parents, and that any website asking for login information outside the official Roblox site is likely a scam. Use real examples to illustrate warning signs.

For younger children, focus on simple rules like "never share your password" and "always ask a parent if something seems wrong." Older children can understand more complex concepts like URL verification and email authentication.

## What should I do if my child fell for a phishing scam?

If your child entered credentials on a fake site, immediately change the account password, enable two-factor authentication if not already active, review recent transactions for unauthorized purchases, and contact Roblox support to report the compromise. Check linked payment methods for unauthorized charges.

Use the incident as a teaching opportunity to reinforce phishing recognition skills. Review and strengthen your protection measures to prevent future incidents.

## Knowledge Synthesis

Recognizing Roblox phishing attempts requires identifying red flags in emails and websites, understanding how phishing attacks work, and teaching children to verify communications before sharing account information. Education combined with technical protection provides the best defense against credential theft.
