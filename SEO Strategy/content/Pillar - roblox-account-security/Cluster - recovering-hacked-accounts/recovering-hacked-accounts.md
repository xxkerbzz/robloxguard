# Recovering Hacked Roblox Accounts: Complete Guide

Recovering hacked Roblox accounts involves contacting Roblox support with account information, verifying identity through email or phone, changing passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, and reviewing transactions for unauthorized purchases.

## Immediate Action Prevents Further Damage

When you discover your child's Roblox account has been hacked, immediate action is essential to prevent further damage. Hackers can make unauthorized purchases, trade away valuable items, or use the account for scams within minutes of gaining access. Quick response minimizes losses and helps secure the account faster.

### Signs of Account Compromise

Signs that an account has been hacked include unauthorized purchases, missing items or Robux, new friends you don't recognize, login notifications from unknown devices or locations, and changed account settings. If you notice any of these signs, assume the account has been compromised and take immediate action.

### Why Quick Action Matters

Hackers act quickly once they gain access, making unauthorized purchases or trading away valuable items before parents notice. The longer an account remains compromised, the more damage can occur. Immediate action can prevent significant financial losses and item theft.

## Contacting Roblox Support for Account Recovery

Roblox support can help recover hacked accounts by verifying your identity and restoring access. Contact support through the official Roblox website, providing as much account information as possible including the account username, email address, and any purchase receipts you have.

### Information Needed for Recovery

Have ready the account username, the email address linked to the account, any purchase receipts or transaction IDs, approximate account creation date, and any other account details you can provide. The more information you can provide, the faster support can verify your identity and recover the account.

### Recovery Process Timeline

Account recovery typically takes 24-48 hours, though it can take longer if additional verification is needed. During this time, the account may remain compromised, so continue monitoring for unauthorized activity and be prepared to report any new issues to support.

## Securing the Account After Recovery

Once you regain access to the account, immediately secure it to prevent future compromise. Change the password to a strong, unique password, enable two-factor authentication if not already active, review and remove any unauthorized payment methods, and check account settings for unauthorized changes.

### Changing Passwords and Enabling 2FA

Create a new strong password that's at least 12 characters long with a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters. Enable two-factor authentication through account settings by linking a parent-controlled phone number or email. This prevents future unauthorized access even if the password is compromised again.

### Reviewing Account Changes

Check all account settings for unauthorized changes including privacy settings, friend request settings, and communication preferences. Review recent transactions for unauthorized purchases and check linked payment methods for unauthorized charges. Report any unauthorized activity to Roblox support.

## Preventing Future Account Compromise

After recovering a hacked account, take steps to prevent future compromise. Use strong, unique passwords, enable two-factor authentication, educate children about phishing and scams, and monitor account activity regularly for signs of unauthorized access.

### Strengthening Account Security

Use a password manager to generate and store strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication on all accounts, review account security settings regularly, and keep recovery information up to date. These measures make accounts significantly harder to compromise.

### Ongoing Monitoring

Monitor account activity regularly for signs of unauthorized access including login notifications from unknown devices, unexpected purchases, or changes to account settings. [Account security](/resources/roblox-account-security) requires ongoing vigilance, not just one-time setup.
