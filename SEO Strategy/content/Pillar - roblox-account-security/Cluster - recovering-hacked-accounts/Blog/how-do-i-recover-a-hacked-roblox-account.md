# How do I recover a hacked Roblox account?

## Topic Foundation

Recovering a hacked Roblox account requires contacting Roblox support, providing account verification information, and securing the account after recovery. Immediate action prevents further damage and helps restore access faster.

## How do I contact Roblox support for account recovery?

Contact Roblox support through the official website, providing as much account information as possible including the account username, email address linked to the account, any purchase receipts or transaction IDs, and approximate account creation date. The more information you provide, the faster support can verify your identity and recover the account.

Support will ask you to verify your identity through the email address or phone number linked to the account. Have access to these verification methods ready, as they're essential for proving account ownership.

## What information do I need for account recovery?

Have ready the account username, the email address linked to the account, any purchase receipts or transaction IDs from legitimate purchases, approximate account creation date, and any other account details you can provide. Screenshots of unauthorized activity can also help support understand what happened.

If you have two-factor authentication enabled, this can help verify your identity faster. Recovery information you set up in advance makes the recovery process smoother.

## How long does account recovery take?

Account recovery typically takes 24-48 hours, though it can take longer if additional verification is needed. During this time, the account may remain compromised, so continue monitoring for unauthorized activity and be prepared to report any new issues to support.

The recovery timeline depends on how quickly you can provide verification information and how complex the compromise was. Providing complete information upfront speeds up the process.

## What should I do immediately after discovering the hack?

Contact Roblox support immediately, change any linked payment method passwords to prevent unauthorized purchases, monitor credit card statements for unauthorized charges, and gather all account information needed for recovery. Quick action prevents further damage.

If you can still access the account, immediately change the password and enable two-factor authentication. If you're locked out, focus on contacting support and securing any linked payment methods.

## How do I secure the account after recovery?

Once you regain access, immediately change the password to a strong, unique password, enable two-factor authentication if not already active, review and remove any unauthorized payment methods, and check all account settings for unauthorized changes.

Review recent transactions for unauthorized purchases and check linked payment methods for unauthorized charges. Report any unauthorized activity to Roblox support and consider temporarily disabling payment methods until the situation is resolved.

## Knowledge Synthesis

Recovering a hacked Roblox account requires contacting support with account information, verifying identity, and securing the account after recovery. Immediate action prevents further damage, and proper security measures prevent future compromise.
