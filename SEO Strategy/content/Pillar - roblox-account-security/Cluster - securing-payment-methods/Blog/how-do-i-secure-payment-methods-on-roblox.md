# How do I secure payment methods on Roblox?

## Topic Foundation

Securing payment methods on Roblox involves using secure payment options like prepaid cards, enabling purchase approval requirements, monitoring transactions in real-time, and removing payment methods when not needed. These measures prevent unauthorized spending and protect your financial information.

## What payment methods are safest for Roblox?

Prepaid cards with limited balances, gift cards, or payment methods that require additional verification provide better protection than credit cards with high limits. These options limit potential losses to the card's balance, preventing unlimited unauthorized spending and can't result in debt.

Prepaid cards are ideal for children's accounts because they provide natural spending limits. Some payment methods also require additional verification for each purchase, such as entering a PIN or confirming through a parent's phone, adding an extra layer of protection.

## How do purchase approval requirements work?

Purchase approval requires parent authorization before purchases are completed. When approval is required, purchase attempts trigger alerts to parents who can approve or deny transactions in real-time, preventing unauthorized spending before money is spent.

Set approval thresholds based on your comfort level with automatic purchases. Some parents prefer to approve all purchases, while others set thresholds that allow small purchases automatically but require approval for larger ones. The threshold can be adjusted as children demonstrate responsible spending.

## Should I monitor payment transactions?

Yes, real-time monitoring provides immediate alerts when purchases are attempted, allowing you to review and approve or block transactions before they're completed. Monitor all purchase attempts, transaction amounts, frequencies, and sources to identify unusual patterns that may indicate unauthorized spending.

Transaction monitoring also provides concrete data for financial discussions with children. Review spending together to understand where money is going and use the data to set appropriate spending limits and approval requirements.

## Should I remove payment methods from my child's account?

Removing payment methods when not needed eliminates the risk of unauthorized spending entirely. Consider removing them during periods when purchases won't be made, when investigating potential security issues, or when you want to enforce a complete spending pause. Payment methods can be added back when needed for legitimate purchases.

This approach provides complete protection while maintaining flexibility. Temporary removal can be useful for teaching moments, budget management, or security concerns.

## How do I know if my payment methods are secure?

Payment methods are secure when they have spending limits, require approval for purchases, are monitored in real-time, and are removed when not needed. Multiple security layers provide the best protection against unauthorized spending, ensuring that even if one layer is compromised, others provide protection.

[Securing payment methods](/resources/roblox-account-security/securing-payment-methods) requires combining technical controls with good practices like using prepaid cards and removing payment methods when not needed.
