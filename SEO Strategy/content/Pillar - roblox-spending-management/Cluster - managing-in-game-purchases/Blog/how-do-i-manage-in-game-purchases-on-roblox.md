# How do I manage in-game purchases on Roblox?

## Topic Foundation

Managing in-game purchases on Roblox involves setting spending limits, requiring approval for purchases, and monitoring purchase history to prevent unauthorized spending. These measures work together to control spending while allowing reasonable enjoyment.

## How do I set spending limits for in-game purchases?

Set spending limits through Roblox account settings or parental control platforms. You can set overall limits or different limits for different types of purchases, such as game passes versus avatar items. Start with conservative limits and adjust based on your child's responsible spending behavior.

Consider your family's budget, your child's age and maturity, and the types of purchases they're making when setting limits. Different limits may be appropriate for different types of purchases or time periods.

## How do purchase approval requirements work?

When approval is required, purchase attempts trigger alerts to parents who can approve or deny transactions in real-time. This prevents purchases before money is spent and creates opportunities for financial education. Set approval thresholds based on your comfort level with automatic purchases.

Some parents prefer to approve all purchases, while others set thresholds that allow small purchases automatically but require approval for larger ones. The threshold can be adjusted as children demonstrate responsible spending.

## How do I monitor in-game purchases?

Monitor purchases through Roblox account settings or parental control platforms that track all purchases, including item names, purchase dates, amounts spent, and the games where purchases were made. Review purchase history regularly to understand spending patterns and detect unauthorized purchases.

Real-time monitoring provides immediate alerts when purchases are attempted, allowing you to review and approve or block transactions before they're completed. This proactive approach prevents unauthorized spending rather than discovering it after the fact.

## Can I set different limits for different types of purchases?

Some parental control platforms allow setting different limits for different types of purchases, such as game passes versus avatar items. This allows more granular control over spending while still allowing reasonable enjoyment. Consider your child's interests and your family's budget when setting these limits.

Different limits for different purchase types help prevent overspending on specific categories while still allowing children to enjoy the game. Regular review ensures limits remain appropriate.

## How do I prevent unauthorized in-game purchases?

Prevent unauthorized purchases by setting spending limits, requiring approval for purchases above thresholds, and monitoring purchase history regularly. Multiple layers of protection ensure that even if one measure fails, others provide protection.

Real-time monitoring provides immediate alerts when purchases are attempted, allowing you to respond quickly to potential unauthorized spending. [Managing in-game purchases](/resources/roblox-spending-management/managing-in-game-purchases) requires ongoing attention, not just one-time setup.

## Knowledge Synthesis
