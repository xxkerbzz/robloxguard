# How do Robux purchases work?

## Topic Foundation

Robux purchases work by allowing children to buy virtual currency with real money, which is then spent on in-game items and features. Understanding how purchases work helps parents monitor spending and prevent unauthorized purchases.

## How do children purchase Robux?

Children purchase Robux through the Roblox website or app using linked payment methods like credit cards, debit cards, or gift cards. Once purchased, Robux is added to the account balance and can be spent on various items and features. Purchases are immediate and cannot be refunded, making it important to monitor spending carefully.

The purchase process is simple and quick, which can lead to impulse purchases if spending isn't controlled. [Understanding Robux purchases](/resources/roblox-spending-management/understanding-robux-purchases) helps parents set appropriate limits and approval requirements.

## What can children buy with Robux?

Children can use Robux to purchase avatar accessories, clothing, animations, game passes that unlock special features in specific games, developer products, and other in-game content. Some items are cosmetic and purely aesthetic, while others provide gameplay advantages or access to exclusive content.

Cosmetic purchases allow children to customize their avatars, while gameplay purchases like game passes provide in-game benefits. Understanding these differences helps parents set appropriate spending limits for different types of purchases.

## How are Robux purchases processed?

Robux purchases are processed immediately through linked payment methods. Once a purchase is made, Robux is added to the account balance and can be spent right away. There's no waiting period or approval process unless parents have set up spending controls.

This immediate processing can lead to rapid spending if limits aren't in place. Parental control platforms can require approval for purchases or set spending limits to prevent unauthorized or excessive spending.

## Can Robux purchases be refunded?

Robux purchases are generally non-refundable, though Roblox support may provide refunds in cases of unauthorized purchases or account compromise. Contact support immediately if you discover unauthorized purchases to maximize the chances of refund approval.

If your child's account was compromised and unauthorized purchases were made, Roblox support can help recover the account and may refund unauthorized purchases when appropriate. Provide all requested information promptly to speed up the process.

## How do I monitor Robux purchases?

Monitor Robux purchases through Roblox account settings or parental control platforms that track all purchases, including item names, purchase dates, and amounts spent. Review purchase history regularly to understand spending patterns and detect unauthorized purchases.

Real-time monitoring provides immediate alerts when purchases are attempted, allowing you to review and approve or block transactions before they're completed. This proactive approach prevents unauthorized spending rather than discovering it after the fact.
