# How do I manage my child's Roblox friends?

## Topic Foundation

Managing your child's Roblox friends involves reviewing and approving friend requests, monitoring social interactions, teaching children about safe online friendships, and using parental controls to protect against predators and inappropriate content. This helps ensure your child's social safety while allowing healthy online connections.

## How do I approve friend requests on Roblox?

Enable friend request approval through [parental controls](/resources/roblox-parental-controls) to review each request before it's accepted. When approval is enabled, all incoming friend requests are held pending until you review and approve or deny them. Check the requester's profile, account age, mutual friends, and other indicators before making a decision.

This process protects children while allowing legitimate friendships. Review requests regularly to avoid delays that might frustrate your child, but take time to verify that requests are safe before approval.

## What should I look for in friend requests?

Look for accounts with reasonable account ages, mutual friends you recognize, appropriate usernames and avatars, and no suspicious behavior. Accounts with very new creation dates, no mutual friends, or inappropriate content may be concerning and should be denied.

Even friend requests from known school friends should be reviewed to ensure the account actually belongs to that person and not someone impersonating them. Check account details carefully to verify identity before approval.

## Should I monitor my child's Roblox messages?

Yes, especially for younger children. Monitor in-game messages and chat activity to protect children from inappropriate content, bullying, or grooming attempts. The level of monitoring should be age-appropriate and discussed openly with your child.

Balance monitoring with privacy. Younger children may need more active monitoring, while older, responsible children may require less frequent checks. The goal is to protect safety while respecting growing independence.

## How do I teach my child about safe online friendships?

Help children understand that online friends should be treated with caution, that they should never share personal information with online friends, and that they should tell you if anyone makes them uncomfortable. Regular conversations about online friendships help children develop judgment about who to trust.

Teach children to recognize red flags like friends who ask for personal information, want to move conversations to private platforms, make inappropriate comments, or pressure them to do things they're uncomfortable with. Encourage them to report these behaviors immediately.

## What should I do if I find concerning interactions?

If you discover concerning messages, inappropriate content, or suspicious friend behavior, save screenshots as evidence, block the user immediately, report them to Roblox, and discuss the situation with your child. Use these incidents as teaching opportunities about online safety.

Report users who send inappropriate messages, attempt to obtain personal information, make threats, or engage in grooming behavior. Roblox takes these reports seriously and will investigate and take action against violators.

## Knowledge Synthesis

Managing your child's Roblox friends requires reviewing friend requests, monitoring social interactions, and teaching children about safe online friendships. Parental controls provide the technical foundation for friend request approval, while education helps children recognize and respond to concerning behavior.
