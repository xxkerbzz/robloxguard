# Managing Roblox Friends and Social Safety: Complete Guide

Managing Roblox friends and social safety involves reviewing and approving friend requests, monitoring in-game messages and interactions, teaching children about online friendships, and using parental controls to protect against predators and inappropriate content.

## Friend Request Management Protects Social Safety

Friend requests on Roblox can come from anyone, including strangers, potential predators, or scammers. Managing friend requests by requiring parent approval before acceptance helps protect children from dangerous interactions. [Parental controls](/resources/roblox-parental-controls) can automatically route friend requests to parents for review.

### Why Friend Request Approval Matters

Friend requests may come from accounts with very new creation dates, accounts with no mutual friends, or accounts that seem suspicious. Without approval requirements, children may accept requests from strangers who could pose safety risks. Approval requirements give parents control over who can interact with their children.

### How Friend Request Approval Works

When friend request approval is enabled, all incoming friend requests are held pending until a parent reviews and approves or denies them. Parents can check the requester's profile, account age, mutual friends, and other indicators before making a decision. This process protects children while allowing legitimate friendships.

## Monitoring Social Interactions Prevents Inappropriate Content

Monitoring in-game messages, chat activity, and social interactions helps protect children from inappropriate content, bullying, or grooming attempts. While complete privacy may be desired by older children, some level of monitoring is essential for safety, especially for younger users.

### What Interactions Should Be Monitored

Key interactions to monitor include in-game messages and chat, friend activity and interactions, group memberships and participation, and voice chat if enabled. Each of these can reveal potential safety concerns or inappropriate behavior that requires attention.

### Balancing Privacy and Safety

The level of monitoring should be age-appropriate and discussed openly with your child. Younger children may need more active monitoring, while older, more responsible children may require less frequent checks. The goal is to protect safety while respecting growing independence.

## Teaching Children About Safe Online Friendships

Help children understand that online friends should be treated with caution, that they should never share personal information with online friends, and that they should tell you if anyone makes them uncomfortable. Regular conversations about online friendships help children develop judgment about who to trust.

### Red Flags in Online Friendships

Concerning signs include friends who ask for personal information, friends who want to move conversations to private platforms, friends who make inappropriate comments, or friends who pressure children to do things they're uncomfortable with. Teach children to recognize these red flags and report them immediately.

### Encouraging Healthy Online Friendships

Not all online friendships are dangerous. Help children understand how to identify safe, healthy friendships while maintaining appropriate boundaries. Encourage friendships with children they know in real life and teach them to be cautious with strangers.

## Responding to Concerning Social Interactions

If you discover concerning messages, inappropriate content, or suspicious friend behavior, save screenshots as evidence, block the user immediately, report them to Roblox, and discuss the situation with your child. Use these incidents as teaching opportunities about online safety.

### When to Report Users

Report users who send inappropriate messages, attempt to obtain personal information, make threats, or engage in grooming behavior. Roblox takes these reports seriously and will investigate and take action against violators. Reporting helps protect not just your child but other children as well.

### Supporting Your Child After Incidents

If your child experiences concerning interactions, provide emotional support and reassurance. Help them understand that they did nothing wrong and that reporting was the right thing to do. Use the incident to reinforce safety education and strengthen protective measures.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Should I approve all friend requests from my child's school friends?

Even friend requests from known school friends should be reviewed to ensure the account actually belongs to that person and not someone impersonating them. Check the account age, mutual friends, and profile information to verify identity before approval.

### How do I know if a friend request is safe?

Safe friend requests typically come from accounts with reasonable account ages, mutual friends you recognize, appropriate usernames and avatars, and no suspicious behavior. When in doubt, deny the request and discuss it with your child.
