# How do I block Roblox scams?

## Topic Foundation

Blocking Roblox scams requires using parental controls to block known scam websites, educating children about common scam tactics, and monitoring account activity for signs of compromise. Technical controls provide automatic protection, while education helps children recognize new threats.

## How do parental controls block scams?

Parental control platforms maintain databases of known scam websites and automatically block access to them. When children attempt to visit these sites, the connection is blocked before the page loads, preventing credential theft. These blocklists are updated regularly as new scam sites are identified.

Some platforms also use pattern recognition to identify potentially fraudulent websites even if they're not yet in blocklists. These systems analyze website characteristics, URLs, and content to detect scams before children can access them. This proactive approach prevents exposure to new threats.

## What types of scams should I block?

The most common Roblox scams include fake Robux generator websites that promise free Robux in exchange for login credentials, phishing emails that appear to be from Roblox support, and social engineering attacks where scammers befriend children before requesting account information. Each type requires different blocking strategies.

Fake Robux generator websites are responsible for thousands of compromised accounts monthly. These sites look legitimate but are designed to steal credentials. [Blocking scams and fraud](/resources/roblox-parental-controls/blocking-scams-and-fraud) requires identifying these sites and preventing access to them.

## Can children bypass scam blocking?

Technical controls that block scam websites externally cannot be bypassed by children, providing reliable protection. These controls work outside the Roblox system, making them impossible for children to disable. However, education is also important to help children recognize new scams that haven't been added to blocklists yet.

The most effective protection combines technical controls with education. Technical controls block known threats automatically, while education helps children identify new threats and make safe decisions even when technical controls aren't present.

## How do I educate my child about scams?

Teach children to recognize red flags like promises of free Robux, requests for passwords, suspicious URLs that don't match the official Roblox domain, and poor website design. Help them understand that legitimate Roblox communications never ask for passwords and that any website offering free Robux is a scam.

Use real examples of scams to illustrate warning signs. Show children examples of fake Robux generator websites and explain why they're dangerous. Regular conversations about scams help children develop recognition skills that protect them from new threats.

## What should I do if my child already fell for a scam?

If your child fell for a scam, immediately change the account password, enable two-factor authentication if not already active, review recent transactions for unauthorized purchases, and contact Roblox support to report the compromise. Check linked payment methods for unauthorized charges and consider temporarily disabling them.

Use the incident as a teaching opportunity to discuss scam recognition and reinforce safety education. Review and strengthen your blocking measures to prevent future incidents.

## Knowledge Synthesis

Blocking Roblox scams requires technical controls that automatically block known scam websites combined with education that helps children recognize new threats. Parental control platforms provide reliable technical protection, while regular conversations about scams help children develop recognition skills.
