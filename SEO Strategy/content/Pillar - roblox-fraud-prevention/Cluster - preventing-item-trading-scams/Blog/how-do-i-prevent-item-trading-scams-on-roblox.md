# How do I prevent item trading scams on Roblox?

## Topic Foundation

Preventing Roblox item trading scams requires teaching children safe trading practices, recognizing common scam tactics, and using parental controls to monitor trading activity. Education combined with technical protection provides the best defense against scams that steal valuable items.

## What are common trading scam tactics?

Common tactics include fake trade offers that promise better items but deliver nothing, trust-building schemes where scammers befriend children before requesting trades, and item duplication scams that claim to duplicate items but actually steal them. Understanding these tactics helps children recognize and avoid scams.

Fake trade offers may seem too good to be true, pressure quick acceptance, or request trades outside the official Roblox trading system. Trust-building schemes exploit established relationships, while duplication scams prey on children's desire for more items.

## How can I teach my child about safe trading?

Teach children to carefully review all trade details before accepting, never trade with strangers, verify the value of items being offered, and ask parents before making high-value trades. Help them recognize red flags like offers that seem too good to be true or pressure to accept trades quickly.

Safe trading practices include only trading with trusted friends, carefully reviewing all trade details, verifying item values before trading, and asking parents for approval on high-value trades. These practices help prevent scams while allowing legitimate trading.

## Can parental controls help prevent trading scams?

Yes, [parental controls](/resources/roblox-parental-controls) can require approval for trades, monitor trading activity, and block trades with suspicious accounts. Some platforms allow parents to require approval for all trades or trades above certain value thresholds, providing visibility and control.

Monitoring trading activity regularly helps identify patterns that may indicate scams. Look for trades with unknown users, trades that seem unfair, or rapid trading activity that may indicate account compromise or scam participation.

## What should I do if my child falls for a trading scam?

If your child falls for a trading scam, contact Roblox support immediately to report the scam and request item recovery. While restoration isn't guaranteed, reporting scams quickly maximizes the chances of recovery. Use the incident as a teaching opportunity to reinforce safe trading practices.

Review and strengthen your protection measures, including enabling trade approval requirements if available. Help your child understand what went wrong and how to recognize similar scams in the future.

## How do I recognize scam trade offers?

Scam trade offers often seem too good to be true, pressure quick acceptance, request trades outside the official system, or come from unknown users. Teach children to carefully review all trade details and ask parents before accepting suspicious offers.

Red flags include offers that promise better items later, requests to trade valuable items for promises, and pressure to accept trades quickly without time to review. Legitimate trades allow time for careful consideration.

## Knowledge Synthesis

Preventing Roblox item trading scams requires teaching children safe trading practices, recognizing common scam tactics, and using parental controls to monitor activity. Education combined with technical protection provides the best defense against scams that steal valuable items.
