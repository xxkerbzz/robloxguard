# How do I know if a Robux generator website is a scam?

## Topic Foundation

All Robux generator websites are scams designed to steal account credentials. Understanding the warning signs helps parents protect their children from these fraudulent sites that promise free Robux but actually compromise accounts and enable unauthorized spending.

## Are all Robux generator websites scams?

Yes, every Robux generator website is a scam. Robux can only be purchased through official Roblox channels or earned through specific programs like the Developer Exchange. There is no legitimate way to generate free Robux through third-party websites, making any site claiming to do so fraudulent by definition.

These websites exist solely to steal account credentials. Once children enter their login information, scammers use it to access accounts, make unauthorized purchases, or trade away valuable items. The promise of free Robux is always a lie designed to trick children into revealing their passwords.

## What are the warning signs of a Robux generator scam?

The clearest warning sign is any promise of free Robux. Legitimate Roblox never gives away Robux through third-party websites. Other red flags include requests for passwords, suspicious URLs that don't match the official Roblox domain, and claims about "generators" or "hacks" that can create Robux.

Poor website design, grammatical errors, and requests to complete surveys or download software are also indicators of scams. However, some scam sites look very professional, so the most reliable indicator is the promise of free Robux itself—this is always fraudulent.

## How do Robux generator scams work?

Robux generator scams work by creating fake websites that look legitimate and promise free Robux in exchange for account login information. Children enter their username and password, believing they'll receive free Robux, but instead the credentials are captured and used to access their accounts.

Once scammers have account access, they can make unauthorized Robux purchases using linked payment methods, trade away valuable items, or use the account to scam other players. The damage can occur within minutes of credential theft, making early detection critical.

## What should I do if my child used a Robux generator website?

If your child entered their account information on a Robux generator website, act immediately to secure the account. Change the password right away, enable two-factor authentication if not already active, review recent transactions for unauthorized purchases, and contact Roblox support to report the compromise.

Check any linked payment methods for unauthorized charges and consider temporarily disabling them. Monitor the account closely for suspicious activity. [Identifying scam websites](/resources/roblox-fraud-prevention/identifying-scam-websites) early helps prevent future incidents, but immediate action is needed if credentials were already entered.

## How can I prevent my child from accessing these scam websites?

Use parental control software that blocks known scam websites and monitors online activity. Educate your child that all offers for free Robux are scams, and that legitimate Roblox never asks for passwords outside the official website. Real-time monitoring can alert you if your child attempts to access suspicious sites.

Consider using browser extensions that warn about potentially dangerous websites. Teach your child to verify any suspicious website with you before entering any information. The combination of technical blocking and education provides the best protection.

## Knowledge Synthesis

Robux generator websites are always scams that steal account credentials. Recognizing the warning signs—promises of free Robux, password requests, and suspicious URLs—helps prevent account compromise. Immediate action is needed if credentials are entered, and prevention requires both technical controls and education.
