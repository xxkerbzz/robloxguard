# Understanding Robux Scams: Complete Protection Guide

Understanding Robux scams involves recognizing fake Robux generator websites that promise free Robux in exchange for account credentials, phishing emails that appear legitimate, and social engineering tactics that trick children into sharing account information.

## Robux Scams Target Children's Desire for Free Currency

Robux scams exploit children's desire for free in-game currency by promising free Robux through fake generators, websites, or "hacks." These scams are designed to steal account credentials, which are then used to access accounts, make unauthorized purchases, or trade away valuable items. Understanding how these scams work helps parents protect their children.

### Why Robux Scams Are Effective

Robux scams are effective because they promise something children want—free currency—without explaining the risks. Children may not understand that these offers are always fraudulent, making them vulnerable to sophisticated scam tactics. The promise of free Robux can override caution, especially when scams look legitimate.

### The Financial Impact of Robux Scams

Robux scams can result in significant financial damage through unauthorized purchases made with stolen account credentials. Scammers may also trade away valuable items or use compromised accounts to scam other players. The cumulative impact can be hundreds of dollars in losses.

## Fake Robux Generator Websites

Fake Robux generator websites are the most common type of Robux scam. These sites promise free Robux in exchange for account login information, claiming to use "generators" or "hacks" to create currency. Once children enter their credentials, scammers use them to access accounts.

### How Fake Generators Work

Fake generator websites create fake login pages that look identical to the real Roblox site. When children enter their username and password, the information is captured and sent to scammers. The sites may claim to be "verifying" the account or "processing" the free Robux, but they're actually stealing credentials.

### Why Free Robux Offers Are Always Scams

Robux can only be purchased through official Roblox channels or earned through specific programs like the Developer Exchange. There is no legitimate way to generate free Robux through third-party websites, making any offer for free Robux fraudulent by definition. Teaching children this fundamental fact helps prevent them from falling for these scams.

## Phishing Emails and Messages

Phishing attacks use fake emails or messages that appear to be from Roblox support, claiming accounts need verification or offering free Robux. These communications often include links to fake websites where children are asked to enter their account information.

### Recognizing Phishing Attempts

Phishing emails often have suspicious sender addresses, contain urgent language pressuring immediate action, request passwords or personal information, or include links to suspicious websites. Legitimate Roblox communications never ask for passwords and always come from official @roblox.com addresses.

### Teaching Children About Phishing

Help children understand that legitimate Roblox communications never ask for passwords, that they should verify suspicious emails with parents, and that any website asking for login information outside the official Roblox site is likely a scam. Regular conversations about phishing help children develop recognition skills.

## Social Engineering Tactics

Social engineering scams build trust over time before attempting to steal account information. Scammers befriend children in-game, gain their trust, and then request account passwords "to help with something" or ask children to trade expensive items. These attacks are particularly effective because they exploit children's natural trust.

### How Social Engineering Works

Social engineering attacks typically involve scammers pretending to be other children or offering rare items in exchange for account access. Over time, they build trust and then request passwords or expensive items. Children, wanting to maintain friendships, often comply without realizing the scam.

### Preventing Social Engineering

Teach children never to share passwords with anyone, even friends they trust in-game. Explain that legitimate friends never need account passwords. Enable friend request approval through [parental controls](/resources/roblox-parental-controls) so you can review each request before it's accepted.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Are all Robux generator websites scams?

### How can I tell if a Robux offer is a scam?
