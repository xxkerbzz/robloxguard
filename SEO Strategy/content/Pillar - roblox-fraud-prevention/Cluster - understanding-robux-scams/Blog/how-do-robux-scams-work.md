# How do Robux scams work?

## Topic Foundation

Robux scams work by promising free Robux through fake generator websites, phishing emails, or social engineering tactics that trick children into sharing account credentials. Understanding how these scams work helps parents protect their children from falling victim.

## What are fake Robux generator websites?

Fake Robux generator websites promise free Robux in exchange for account login information. They create fake login pages that look identical to the real Roblox site, capturing credentials when children enter them. The sites may claim to be "verifying" the account or "processing" the free Robux, but they're actually stealing credentials.

Once scammers have account access, they can make unauthorized purchases, trade away valuable items, or use the account to scam other players. These scams are responsible for thousands of compromised accounts monthly.

## How do phishing Robux scams work?

Phishing attacks use fake emails or messages that appear to be from Roblox support, claiming accounts need verification or offering free Robux. These communications often include links to fake websites where children are asked to enter their account information.

Phishing emails often have suspicious sender addresses, contain urgent language pressuring immediate action, or request passwords. Legitimate Roblox communications never ask for passwords and always come from official @roblox.com addresses.

## How does social engineering work in Robux scams?

Social engineering scams build trust over time before attempting to steal account information. Scammers befriend children in-game, gain their trust, and then request account passwords "to help with something" or ask children to trade expensive items. These attacks are particularly effective because they exploit children's natural trust.

Scammers typically pretend to be other children or offer rare items in exchange for account access. Over time, they build trust and then request passwords or expensive items. Children, wanting to maintain friendships, often comply without realizing the scam.

## Why are Robux scams effective?

Robux scams are effective because they promise something children want—free currency—without explaining the risks. Children may not understand that these offers are always fraudulent, making them vulnerable to sophisticated scam tactics. The promise of free Robux can override caution, especially when scams look legitimate.

Scammers use professional-looking websites and convincing language to make their scams appear legitimate. Without education about how these scams work, children may not recognize the warning signs.

## How can I protect my child from Robux scams?

Teach children that all free Robux offers are scams, use [parental controls](/resources/roblox-parental-controls) to block known scam websites, and monitor account activity for signs of compromise. Education combined with technical protection provides the best defense.

Help children understand that Robux can only be purchased through official Roblox channels or earned through specific programs. Any website, email, or message promising free Robux is designed to steal account credentials.

## Knowledge Synthesis

Robux scams work through fake generator websites, phishing attempts, and social engineering tactics that exploit children's desire for free currency. Understanding how these scams work helps parents protect their children through education and technical controls.
