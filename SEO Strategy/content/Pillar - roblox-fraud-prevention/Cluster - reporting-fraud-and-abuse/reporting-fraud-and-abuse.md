# Reporting Roblox Fraud and Abuse: Complete Guide

Reporting Roblox fraud and abuse involves documenting incidents with screenshots, contacting Roblox support through official channels, providing detailed information about scams or inappropriate behavior, and following up to ensure action is taken.

## Reporting Helps Protect Your Child and Others

Reporting fraud and abuse to Roblox helps protect not just your child, but other children as well. When scammers and predators are reported, Roblox can take action including account bans, item recovery, and legal reporting when appropriate. Your reports make the platform safer for everyone.

### Why Reporting Matters

Reporting incidents helps Roblox identify patterns of abuse, take action against repeat offenders, and improve platform safety measures. Even if your child's specific incident can't be resolved, your report may help prevent future incidents for other children.

### Types of Incidents to Report

Report unauthorized account access, fraudulent purchases, scam websites or users, inappropriate messages or content, grooming attempts, bullying or harassment, and any other behavior that violates Roblox's terms of service or community guidelines.

## Documenting Incidents for Reporting

Document incidents thoroughly before reporting, as detailed information helps Roblox take action faster. Take screenshots of scam websites, fraudulent messages, unauthorized transactions, and any other evidence of fraud or abuse.

### What to Document

Document the date and time of incidents, usernames of involved accounts, screenshots of conversations or transactions, URLs of scam websites, transaction IDs for unauthorized purchases, and any other relevant information. The more detail you provide, the faster Roblox can investigate and take action.

### Preserving Evidence

Save screenshots and documentation immediately, as some evidence may be deleted or become unavailable over time. Store evidence in multiple locations to ensure it's not lost, and keep records even after reporting in case follow-up is needed.

## Contacting Roblox Support

Contact Roblox support through the official website's support section, providing all documented evidence and detailed information about the incident. Use the appropriate reporting category—fraud, abuse, account security, or other—to ensure your report reaches the right team.

### Information to Include in Reports

Include your child's account username, the date and time of the incident, detailed description of what happened, screenshots or other evidence, usernames of involved accounts, and any transaction IDs or other relevant information. Complete reports are processed faster than incomplete ones.

### Following Up on Reports

Follow up on reports if you don't receive a response within 48-72 hours, or if the situation worsens. Keep your report reference number and use it when following up. Roblox support typically responds within 24-48 hours, but complex cases may take longer.

## Reporting Different Types of Incidents

Different types of incidents require different reporting approaches. Fraud and scams should be reported through the fraud reporting system, while abuse and inappropriate behavior should be reported through the abuse reporting system. Understanding the correct reporting channel ensures your report is handled appropriately.

### Reporting Fraud and Scams

Report fraud and scams through Roblox's fraud reporting system, providing evidence of unauthorized purchases, scam websites, or credential theft. Include transaction IDs, screenshots of scam websites, and any other evidence of fraudulent activity.

### Reporting Abuse and Inappropriate Behavior

Report abuse and inappropriate behavior through Roblox's abuse reporting system, providing screenshots of conversations, usernames of involved accounts, and detailed descriptions of the behavior. Roblox takes abuse reports seriously and will investigate and take action against violators.

## What Happens After Reporting

After reporting, Roblox will investigate the incident and take appropriate action. This may include banning offending accounts, recovering stolen items, refunding unauthorized purchases, or taking legal action in severe cases. You'll typically receive updates on the investigation and any actions taken.

### Account Recovery After Reporting

If your child's account was compromised, Roblox support can help recover access and restore items when possible. Provide all requested information promptly to speed up the recovery process. Recovery success depends on how quickly incidents are reported and how much information is available.

### Preventing Future Incidents

After reporting incidents, review and strengthen your protection measures. Enable additional security features, educate children about recognizing scams, and consider using [parental controls](/resources/roblox-parental-controls) for enhanced protection. Learning from incidents helps prevent future problems.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does it take for Roblox to respond to reports?

Roblox typically responds to reports within 24-48 hours, though complex cases may take longer. Follow up if you don't receive a response within 72 hours, or if the situation worsens.

### Can I recover items or money lost to scams?

Roblox support may be able to recover items or refund unauthorized purchases if scams are reported quickly and sufficient evidence is provided. Recovery success depends on how quickly incidents are reported and the specific circumstances.
