# How do I report fraud on Roblox?

## Topic Foundation

Reporting fraud on Roblox involves documenting incidents with screenshots, contacting Roblox support through official channels, and providing detailed information to help Roblox take action against scammers. Quick reporting maximizes the chances of recovery and helps protect other children.

## How do I contact Roblox support to report fraud?

Contact Roblox support through the official website's support section, providing all documented evidence and detailed information about the incident. Use the fraud reporting category to ensure your report reaches the right team. Include your child's account username, date and time of the incident, and all available evidence.

Complete reports with evidence are processed faster than incomplete ones. Save your report reference number and use it when following up if needed.

## What information should I include when reporting fraud?

Include your child's account username, the date and time of the incident, detailed description of what happened, screenshots or other evidence, usernames of involved accounts, and any transaction IDs or other relevant information. The more detail you provide, the faster Roblox can investigate and take action.

Document incidents thoroughly before reporting, as detailed information helps Roblox take action faster. Take screenshots of scam websites, fraudulent messages, unauthorized transactions, and any other evidence of fraud.

## How do I document fraud incidents?

Take screenshots of scam websites, fraudulent messages, unauthorized transactions, and any other evidence immediately, as some evidence may be deleted or become unavailable over time. Save screenshots and documentation in multiple locations to ensure it's not lost.

Document the date and time of incidents, usernames of involved accounts, URLs of scam websites, transaction IDs for unauthorized purchases, and any other relevant information. Keep records even after reporting in case follow-up is needed.

## Can I recover items or money lost to fraud?

Roblox support may be able to recover items or refund unauthorized purchases if scams are reported quickly and sufficient evidence is provided. Recovery success depends on how quickly incidents are reported and the specific circumstances. Contact support immediately after discovering fraud to maximize recovery chances.

If your child's account was compromised, Roblox support can help recover access and restore items when possible. Provide all requested information promptly to speed up the recovery process.

## How long does it take for Roblox to respond?

Roblox typically responds to reports within 24-48 hours, though complex cases may take longer. Follow up if you don't receive a response within 72 hours, or if the situation worsens. Keep your report reference number and use it when following up.

After reporting, Roblox will investigate the incident and take appropriate action. This may include banning offending accounts, recovering stolen items, refunding unauthorized purchases, or taking legal action in severe cases.

## Knowledge Synthesis

Reporting fraud on Roblox requires documenting incidents thoroughly, contacting support through official channels, and providing detailed information. Quick reporting with complete evidence maximizes the chances of recovery and helps protect other children from the same scams.
