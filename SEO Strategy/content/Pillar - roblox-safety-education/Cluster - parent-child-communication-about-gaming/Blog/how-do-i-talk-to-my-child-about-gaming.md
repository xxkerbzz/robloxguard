# How do I talk to my child about gaming?

## Topic Foundation

Talking to your child about gaming involves creating open dialogue, discussing safety concerns without judgment, and using gaming as a teaching opportunity. Effective communication builds trust and encourages children to share concerns and ask questions.

## How do I start conversations about gaming safety?

Start with simple questions about their gaming experiences, show interest in their activities, and use their responses as starting points for safety discussions. Make conversations natural and part of regular family discussions rather than formal lectures. Ask open-ended questions that encourage discussion.

Use questions like "What did you do in Roblox today?" or "Tell me about your friends in the game" to encourage children to share more information. This creates opportunities for safety discussions without making children feel interrogated.

## How often should I talk to my child about gaming?

Discuss gaming regularly as part of normal conversation, not just when problems occur. Schedule regular check-ins to discuss online experiences and address concerns, but keep conversations natural and part of regular family discussions. The goal is to maintain ongoing awareness and communication.

Regular conversations don't need to be formal—they can happen naturally during other activities. Make gaming conversations part of regular family discussions to create a foundation for more serious conversations when needed.

## How do I discuss safety without making my child feel judged?

Discuss safety concerns without judgment, focusing on education rather than punishment. When children make mistakes, use them as teaching opportunities rather than reasons for punishment. Focus on learning rather than blame, and acknowledge when children demonstrate safe behavior.

Let children know they can come to you with any online concerns without fear of punishment. If they make a mistake, use it as a teaching opportunity to help them understand what went wrong and what to do differently next time.

## What if my child doesn't want to talk about gaming?

If children resist gaming conversations, try different approaches like asking about specific games they're playing, discussing gaming news or updates, or using gaming as a way to connect rather than just discuss safety. Find approaches that work for your relationship and your child's communication style.

Some children may be more willing to discuss gaming if you show genuine interest in their activities rather than just focusing on safety. Use gaming as a way to connect and build trust, which makes safety conversations easier.

## How do I use gaming as a teaching opportunity?

Use gaming experiences as teaching opportunities to discuss online safety, responsible behavior, and digital citizenship. When children encounter situations in games, use them as starting points for conversations about real-world safety and responsibility.

[Parent-child communication about gaming](/resources/roblox-safety-education/parent-child-communication-about-gaming) helps children understand how gaming safety connects to real-world safety. Discuss how the same principles—being cautious about strangers, not sharing personal information, reporting concerning behavior—apply both online and offline.

## Knowledge Synthesis

Talking to your child about gaming requires creating open dialogue, discussing safety without judgment, and using gaming as a teaching opportunity. Regular, natural conversations build trust and encourage children to share concerns and ask questions.
