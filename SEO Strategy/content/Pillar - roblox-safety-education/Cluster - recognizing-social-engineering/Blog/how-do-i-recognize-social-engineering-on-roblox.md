# How do I recognize social engineering on Roblox?

## Topic Foundation

Recognizing social engineering on Roblox involves identifying tactics where scammers build trust over time before requesting account information, expensive items, or personal details. Understanding these tactics helps protect children from manipulation and deception.

## What are common social engineering tactics on Roblox?

Common tactics include trust-building schemes where scammers befriend children before making requests, fake friendship offers that promise rare items or exclusive access, and manipulation tactics that pressure children into sharing information or making trades. These tactics exploit children's trust and desire for friendship.

Trust-building schemes involve scammers spending weeks or months building relationships before requesting passwords, expensive items, or personal information. Fake friendship offers promise benefits that seem too good to be true, while manipulation tactics use pressure to force quick decisions.

## How can I teach my child to recognize social engineering?

Teach children to recognize red flags like requests for passwords or personal information, pressure to make quick decisions, offers that seem too good to be true, and requests to move conversations to private platforms. Help them understand that legitimate friends never need account passwords.

Build critical thinking skills by discussing why legitimate friends never need account passwords, why offers that seem too good to be true are usually scams, and why they should always ask parents before sharing information or making high-value trades.

## What are the red flags of social engineering?

Red flags include friends who ask for passwords, pressure to make trades quickly, offers that seem too good to be true, requests to move conversations to private platforms, and any behavior that makes children uncomfortable. Teach children to trust their instincts and report concerning behavior.

[Recognizing social engineering](/resources/roblox-safety-education/recognizing-social-engineering) requires understanding that manipulation can come from trusted-seeming sources. Children need to learn to question requests even from people they consider friends.

## Can parental controls prevent social engineering?

Parental controls can help by requiring approval for friend requests and monitoring messages, but education is also essential. Children who understand manipulation tactics are less likely to fall victim even when technical controls aren't present. The best protection combines both technical controls and education.

Enable friend request approval through parental controls to review each request, monitor in-game messages for suspicious content, and use controls as a teaching tool to discuss why certain requests are concerning.

## What should I do if my child falls for social engineering?

If your child falls for social engineering, secure the account immediately by changing passwords, reviewing recent transactions for unauthorized purchases, and checking account settings for unauthorized changes. Use the incident as a teaching opportunity to reinforce safety education.

Contact Roblox support if account compromise occurred, and help your child understand what went wrong and how to recognize similar tactics in the future. Strengthen protection measures to prevent future incidents.

## Knowledge Synthesis

Recognizing social engineering on Roblox requires understanding common manipulation tactics, teaching children to recognize red flags, and using parental controls combined with education. Children who understand these tactics are less likely to fall victim to manipulation.
