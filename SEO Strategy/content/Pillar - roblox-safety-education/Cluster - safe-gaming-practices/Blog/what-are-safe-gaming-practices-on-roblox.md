# What are safe gaming practices on Roblox?

## Topic Foundation

Safe gaming practices on Roblox involve account security, privacy protection, and responsible online behavior that protect children's accounts and safety. These practices become automatic with education and reinforcement, providing ongoing protection.

## What account security practices should children follow?

Children should use strong, unique passwords that are at least 12 characters long with a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters. Enable two-factor authentication through account settings, never share passwords with anyone, and regularly review account settings for unauthorized changes. These practices protect accounts from compromise.

Consider using a password manager to generate and store secure passwords, eliminating the need for children to remember complex combinations while ensuring strong security.

## What privacy protection practices are important?

Children should never share personal information like real names, addresses, phone numbers, or school names with anyone online, even friends. Review privacy settings together and explain why certain information should stay private. Help children understand that information shared online can have real-world consequences.

Teach children that people online may not be who they claim to be, and that sharing information can have serious consequences. [Safe gaming practices](/resources/roblox-safety-education/safe-gaming-practices) help protect privacy while still allowing children to enjoy the game.

## What social safety practices should children follow?

Children should be cautious about friend requests, especially from accounts with very new creation dates, no mutual friends, or inappropriate usernames. Never meet online friends in person, report suspicious behavior to parents or through Roblox's reporting system, and tell parents if anyone makes them uncomfortable.

Enable friend request approval through parental controls to review each request before it's accepted. Teach children that reporting suspicious behavior is not tattling—it's protecting themselves and others.

## How do I teach my child safe gaming practices?

Start with simple, age-appropriate rules and gradually introduce more complex concepts as children mature. Use real examples to illustrate concepts, practice safe habits together, and acknowledge when children demonstrate safe behavior. Regular conversations keep safety awareness current.

For younger children, focus on basic rules like "never share your password" and "always ask a parent if something seems wrong." Older children can understand more complex concepts like recognizing manipulation tactics and understanding privacy implications.

## What should I do if my child breaks a safety rule?

Use mistakes as teaching opportunities rather than reasons for punishment. Help children understand what went wrong, why the rule exists, and what to do differently next time. This approach encourages honesty and helps you address issues before they become serious problems.

If a safety rule is broken, secure the account immediately if necessary, review what happened, and use the incident to reinforce safety education. Focus on learning rather than blame.

## Knowledge Synthesis

Safe gaming practices on Roblox involve account security, privacy protection, and responsible online behavior. Teaching these practices through age-appropriate education and reinforcement helps children develop safe habits that protect their accounts and safety.
