# Safe Gaming Practices on Roblox: Complete Guide

Safe gaming practices on Roblox involve using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, never sharing personal information, being cautious about friend requests, and reporting suspicious behavior to protect children's accounts and safety.

## Safe Gaming Practices Protect Accounts and Privacy

Safe gaming practices on Roblox protect children's accounts from compromise, prevent exposure of personal information, and help children avoid scams and inappropriate content. These practices become automatic with education and reinforcement, providing ongoing protection even when parents aren't present.

### Why Safe Practices Matter

Roblox has millions of active users, including scammers and predators who target children. Safe gaming practices help children protect themselves from these threats while still enjoying the game. Education about safe practices empowers children to make safe decisions independently.

### Building Safe Habits

Safe gaming practices become habits with regular reinforcement and practice. Help children practice these habits regularly, acknowledge when they demonstrate safe behavior, and use mistakes as teaching opportunities rather than reasons for punishment.

## Account Security Practices

Account security practices include using strong, unique passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, never sharing passwords with anyone, and regularly reviewing account settings for unauthorized changes. These practices protect accounts from compromise and unauthorized access.

### Password Security

Use strong passwords that are at least 12 characters long with a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid personal information like names or birthdays that could be easily guessed. Consider using a password manager to generate and store secure passwords.

### Two-Factor Authentication

Enable two-factor authentication through account settings by linking a parent-controlled phone number or email. This requires a verification code beyond the password, preventing unauthorized access even if the password is compromised.

## Privacy Protection Practices

Privacy protection practices include never sharing personal information like real names, addresses, phone numbers, or school names with anyone online, even friends. Help children understand that information shared online can have real-world consequences.

### What Information Should Stay Private

Teach children that passwords, real names, addresses, phone numbers, school names, and photos should never be shared online, even with people they trust in-game. Explain that people online may not be who they claim to be, and that sharing information can have real-world consequences.

### Privacy Settings

Review privacy settings together and explain what each setting does. Help children understand how to control what information is visible to others and why certain settings should be enabled. This hands-on approach helps children understand privacy in practical terms.

## Social Safety Practices

Social safety practices include being cautious about friend requests, never meeting online friends in person, reporting suspicious behavior, and telling parents if anyone makes them uncomfortable. These practices protect children from predators and inappropriate interactions.

### Friend Request Safety

Teach children to be cautious about friend requests, especially from accounts with very new creation dates, no mutual friends, or inappropriate usernames. Enable friend request approval through [parental controls](/resources/roblox-parental-controls) to review each request before it's accepted.

### Reporting Suspicious Behavior

Teach children to report suspicious behavior to parents or through Roblox's reporting system. Make it clear that reporting is not tattling—it's protecting themselves and others. Children who feel comfortable reporting concerns are more likely to seek help when needed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I teach my child safe gaming practices?

Start with simple, age-appropriate rules and gradually introduce more complex concepts as children mature. Use real examples to illustrate concepts, practice safe habits together, and acknowledge when children demonstrate safe behavior. Regular conversations keep safety awareness current.

### What should I do if my child breaks a safety rule?

Use mistakes as teaching opportunities rather than reasons for punishment. Help children understand what went wrong, why the rule exists, and what to do differently next time. This approach encourages honesty and helps you address issues before they become serious problems.
